# Machine Learning Practice Project – Customer Purchase Value

## Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning workflow to estimate customer purchase value using multi-session behavioral data collected across digital touchpoints.

The objective is to apply core machine learning concepts learned during coursework to a real-world dataset and follow a structured, interview-oriented ML pipeline.

## Problem Description
Given anonymized user interaction data such as device information, traffic source, browser type, and geographic indicators, the task is to estimate the purchase value associated with each user session.

## Approach
The project follows a standard supervised machine learning workflow:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature behavior and patterns
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Model training using multiple machine learning algorithms
- Model optimization and evaluation
- Performance comparison to identify effective modeling approaches

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib

## Evaluation
Models were evaluated using appropriate regression metrics to compare performance and assess generalization.

## Key Learnings
- Practical experience with end-to-end machine learning pipelines
- Strong understanding of EDA, model training, optimization, and evaluation
- Exposure to real-world behavioral data and modeling challenges
- Project validated through an industry-evaluated viva
